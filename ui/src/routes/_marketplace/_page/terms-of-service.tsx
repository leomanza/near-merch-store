          Prices are displayed in USD unless otherwise indicated. We reserve the right to

          By placing an order, you make an offer to purchase the products. We reserve the

          errors in pricing or product information, or suspected fraud.

          If you pay with cryptocurrency, the conversion rate is determined at checkout. Due 
          to market volatility, the fiat equivalent may differ from the displayed price at

          Estimated delivery times are provided at checkout but are not guaranteed. Delivery
